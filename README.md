# CSharpExamples

Throughout my career, I have tought several .Net programming courses, many for students new to software development and some to retool from another language like PHP. This repo contains some of the examples and exercises I created to illustrate various concepts. Though the framework used is old, the code itself is still relevant so I haven't bothered to update it yet. Feel free to use any or all of it.
